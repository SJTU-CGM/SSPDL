# Structure Sequence Pattern Description Language

SSPDL is a model for description of patterns in biological sequences. This repository contains the model definition (Language Definition), a graphical editor (Pattern Editor) and a scanner (Instance Finder) for search of putative pattern instances in a given sequence.

You may try the graphical editor by visiting this website (https://sjtu-cgm.github.io/SSPDL/).
